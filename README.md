# Harness Generator with LLM

## Overview
This project provides a **Python-based tool** that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to automatically generate `harness.c` files for software verification tasks.  
Given a function name and its file path, the script connects to the LLM, analyzes the function‚Äôs structure, and produces a corresponding `harness.c` file to simplify verification and testing.

---

## Features
- Connects to an LLM via the `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Takes a function name and source file path as input
- Automatically generates `harness.c` files
- Organizes harnesses in function-specific directories
- Supports reproducible experiments for verification workflows
