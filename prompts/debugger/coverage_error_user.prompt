Harness execution no longer reaches the line where the error occurred.
First, check for any conditional statements in the target function that could prevent coverage of the failing line.

Then, determine why your previous precondition may have prevented coverage of the failing line.

Finally, create a new precondition that still resolves the error without reducing line coverage in the target function.
