When attempting to insert the new preconditions into the harness, we could not find a match for the previous line of code you provided: {previous_line}.

Please use the following steps to understand the cause of the error and fix your precondition appropriately.
1. Confirm this line of code is actually exists in the harness file and the syntax matches exactly.
2. If the syntax was mismatched, please provide the same precondition but with a previous line of code that exactly matches the syntax.
3. If the syntax is correct, double-check that this previous line of code exists in the {function} function.
4. If you did not provide the correct function in your response, please provide the same precondition with the correct function that contains the previous line of code.

Follow this debugging process to revise your previous precondition.
