The previously suggested precondition caused a compilation error, the make command failed.

Review each of your previously suggested preconditions and check if the following requirements are met:
1. The precondition only uses valid C syntax
2. The precondition only uses variables in scope of your chosen function (local or global variables).
3. For each variable used in the pre-conditions, was it defined before the line where the precondition was inserted?
4. Check if all the required headers are correctly imported at the beginning of the file

Based on these steps, determine why your previous preconditions caused a syntax error in the harness.
If you believe the precondition is still logically valid, provide a revised version that fixes the compilation error.

Otherwise, repeat your analysis and provide improved harness file.
