The previously suggested precondition caused a compilation error, the make command failed.

This is the output of the failing make command

{make_output}

Using the make output command and reviewing each of your previously suggested preconditions, check if the following requirements are met:
1. The precondition only uses valid C syntax
2. The precondition only uses variables in scope of your chosen function (local or global variables).
3. For each variable used in the pre-conditions, was it defined before the line where the precondition was inserted?
4. Check if all the required headers are correctly imported at the beginning of the file (Using #include)

Based on these steps, determine why your previous preconditions caused a syntax error in the harness.
If you believe the precondition is still logically valid, provide a revised version that fixes the compilation error.

Otherwise, repeat your analysis and provide improved harness file.

Provide your response in the specified schema format.
