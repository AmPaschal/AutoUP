The previously suggested precondition introduced the following new CBMC errors to the harness:
{new_errors}

First, consider the variables you used in the precondition and determine why they caused new errors in the harness.
Then, evaluate which of these variables are absolutely necessary to resolve the original error, and restrict your next response to only those variables.
Finally, provide a revision of your precondition or suggest additional new preconditions that will prevent any memory errors from occuring within the definitions of your preconditions.
