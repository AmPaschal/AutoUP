Your last change was ILLEGAL because it reduced the number of memory safety properties being verified.

This happened because your harness update caused functions or code paths to be removed or stubbed out, which eliminated {initial_count} - {new_count} = {removed_count} memory safety properties that were previously being checked.

The following properties were removed:
{removed_properties}

{diff}

Your change most likely stubbed or replaced a function that was being called from the target function. This is NOT allowed because it reduces the verification scope.

Try to address the original error WITHOUT:
1. Stubbing out or replacing any functions that are called from the target function
2. Removing any function calls
3. Making changes that would prevent previously verified code paths from being reached

Instead:
1. Add preconditions that constrain inputs to prevent the error
2. Ensure all original function calls are preserved
3. Maintain the same verification scope as before

Provide your response in the specified schema format with an updated_harness that addresses the error while preserving all memory safety properties.
