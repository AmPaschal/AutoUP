The previously suggested precondition caused a syntax error in the harness.

Review each of your previously suggested preconditions and check if the following requirements are met:
1. The precondition only uses valid C syntax
2. The precondition only uses variables in scope of your chosen function (local or global variables).
3. For each variable used in your pre-condition, was it defined before the line where the precondition was inserted?

Based on these steps, determine why your previous preconditions caused a syntax error in the harness.
If you believe the precondition is still logically valid, provide a revised version of the precondition that fixes the syntax error.

Otherwise, repeat your analysis and provide an improved set of preconditions.
