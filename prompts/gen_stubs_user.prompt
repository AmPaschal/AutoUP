Your job is to create stubs for the functions below and integrate them in the provided harness:

<stubs-required>
{STUBS_REQUIRED}
</stubs-required>

<harness>
{HARNESS_CODE}
</harness>

<makefile>
{MAKEFILE_CODE}
</makefile

If you would like to get more information about the codebase to help you identify necessary include statements or type definitions, 
you can run bash commands using the provided function tool 'run_bash_command' or 'run_cscope_command'. 
These commands will be run from the project directory `{PROJECT_DIR}`, and the output will be formatted as a JSON object 
containing the original command, the exit code, stdout output, and stderr output. 

In your response, you are to include an updated and compilable harness and a detailed analysis of the steps you took to generate the stubs.
