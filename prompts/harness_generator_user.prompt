Your job is to create a compilable CBMC harness for the function below:

<function_name>
{FUNCTION_NAME}
</function_name>

<function_source_file>
{FUNCTION_SOURCE_FILE}
</function_source_file>

<function_source>
{FUNCTION_SOURCE}
</function_source>

If you would like to get more information about the codebase to help you fill in these fields, 
you can run bash commands using the provided function 'run_bash_command'. 
These commands will be run from the project directory `{PROJECT_DIR}`, and the output will be formatted as a JSON object 
containing the original command, the exit code, stdout output, and stderr output. 

In your response, you are to include a compilable harness and a detailed analysis of the steps you took to generate the harness.
