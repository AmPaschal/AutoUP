Below are details about loops that have loop unwinding failures in the current CBMC verification.

## Loops with Unwinding Failures

The following loops exceeded their unwinding limit during verification:

{LOOPS_WITH_FAILURES}

## Loop Source Code

Here is the source code around each loop:

{LOOP_SOURCES}

## Current Makefile

{CURRENT_MAKEFILE}

## Current Harness

Review this harness for `__CPROVER_assume` preconditions that may define bounds on allocation sizes:

{CURRENT_HARNESS}

## Project Information

- Project directory: {PROJECT_DIR}
- Harness directory: {HARNESS_DIR}

## Your Task

1. Analyze each loop with an unwinding failure
2. Determine if it has iteration-dependent memory operations
3. Calculate the minimum iterations needed to access invalid memory
4. Check `__CPROVER_assume` statements for allocation bounds
5. Provide an updated Makefile with appropriate `--unwindset` flags

Remember:
- Only set unwindset for loops with genuine vulnerability potential
- Skip loops without iteration-dependent memory operations
- Skip unbounded allocations without a lower bound precondition
- Use the minimum necessary unwind value
